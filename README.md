### Hi ðŸ‘‹

<p> Iâ€™m <strong>Venkat</strong> (<em>he/him/his</em>). Iâ€™m a PhD student in Computational Linguistics at The University of Texas at Austin. My research focuses on intergroup biases in online communication. I'm fortunate to be a member of <a href="https://www.nlp.utexas.edu">a rich group of researchers working on NLP at UT</a>.

<p>Outside of research, I love cooking,<s>running,</s> strength training, biking, building <a href="/apps">apps</a> for Apple platforms, and <a href="https://letterboxd.com/venkatasg/">the movies</a>.</p>

<p>My full name is really long &mdash; unless you're citing me in a paper or official document, call me Venkat.</p>
